# consoleApp


This is a console application and the namespace is ConsoleApps Create two classes as follows: 
Program.cs Will instantiate the class FinalExam and test all of the methods you will create in FinalExam. 
Must use the following data: 
Ford, Mustang, 2016, Red, $35,059 Chevy, Camaro, 2016, Blue, $36.425 Dodge, Charger, 2016, Yellow, $38,295 

A report must be generated using toString with the following output Make Model Year Color Price Ford Mustang 2016 Red $35,059 Chevy Camaro 2016 Blue $36,425 Dodge Charger 2016 Yellow $38,295 

FinalExam.cs Must contain the following attributes:
 Make, Model, Year, Color, Price Must contain the following behaviors: Constructors,Getters, Setters, ToString
———///


just to be a little more clear there should be two different files and that should be program.cs and FinalExam.cs so the code is separated where program.cs is the main class file and finalexam.cs is the just the class file that runs with it

so it should be separated into two things
